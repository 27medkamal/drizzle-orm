# New Features

## Possibility to use multiple drizzle packages in a monorepo

By replacing all `instanceof` statements with a custom `is()` function, it helped us handle multiple drizzle packages properly and treat them as one. So if you use them interchangeably, you will still have functional drizzle queries.

> It also fixes one of the biggest discord tickets: `maximum call stack exceeded` ðŸŽ‰

You can also use this function to check if specific objects are instances of specific drizzle types. It's usable if you are building anything on top of drizzle api

```ts
import { is, Column } from 'drizzle-orm'

is(value, Column)
```

## `distinct` statement is now available for all supported dialects

**Usage example**

```ts
await db.selectDistinct().from(usersDistinctTable).orderBy(
    usersDistinctTable.id,
    usersDistinctTable.name,
);
```

- `distinct on` statement is now available for all supported dialects

**Usage example**

```ts
await db.selectDistinctOn([usersDistinctTable.id]).from(usersDistinctTable).orderBy(
  usersDistinctTable.id,
);

await db.selectDistinctOn([usersDistinctTable.name], { name: usersDistinctTable.name }).from(
  usersDistinctTable,
).orderBy(usersDistinctTable.name);
```

## New `bigint` mode for SQLite

thanks @MrRahulRamkumar

**Usage example**

```ts
const users = sqliteTable('users', {
  blobBigInt: blob('blob', { mode: 'bigint' }).notNull(),
});
```
